Long, long ago, when the earth was young and beer was not chilled by the pagan entites of fridges, this debate was carved in the stone of UA history. But since this debate was that old, it is only preserved by the re-post of another, but it is displayed here in all it's glory so that you may learn... or laugh :-)

Aldi is tops, If I didn't live in Fallowfield I'd shop there.
In years to come Aldi bags will be worth millions

Personally I think Kwik Save Bags are stylish in a subdued,
definitely-non-tacky kind of way...

although I have gained a large collection of Gateway bags recently,
but they are thin and so fall apart quite easily.
Therefore I conclude Aldi bags are the best so far

I find that Kwik Save bags (and Aldi ones I s'pose) are
far better than those from supermarkets at the lower end of
the scale (eg. Safeway, Asda etc. &lt;- Sorry for swearing...)
because they're the ones that don't crinkle and make a hell
of a noise. Walking down the street and being embarrased by
your carrier bag is _far_ worse than than any other social
faux-pas you care to mention.

HERETIC! BURN THE HERETIC!

Indeed it is. But an Aldi bag would only split on you after years, even
decades
of fathful service, and as such can *never* cause embarrassment. In fact,
when
an Aldi bag breaks, it is more akin to a death of a close relative than to
anything remotely resembling embarrassment....

Kwik Save bags only last two or three trips, but remember,
An Aldi bag is not just for shopping, it's for life

Personally, I always put my faith in a good, old-fashioned
Lo-Cost bag.  Shunned by it's "richer" relatives, it's always
there when you need it and gives a comforting feeling of bloaty
stretchiness when full.

I owe my life to Lo-cost bags: one night, whilst safely asleep
upstairs in my mongoose-hole (honest,) a fire started blazing
through my house.  I awoke, to find the flames lapping hungrily
at my door?  What could I do?  Well, thanks the good old
fashioned strength in your average Lo-cost bag I simply tied a
few together into a rope and scrambled out the window to
freedom.
The point?  Well, Aldi may make their bags out of this new
fangled plastic but in a crisis it's prone to melt.  Lo-cost
prefer the more ancient method of fashioning their carrier bags
from steel so they don't let you down in high temperature
crisis.

Soon to come (I heard this on the Aldi grapevine) are a new range
of surreal Aldi carrier bags, based on the astounding fact (and
not coincidence) that Aldi is an anagram of Dali (actually it's
the other way around, I think that Salvador bloke named himself
after Aldi in respectful homage)
 
So, expect to be carrying around Aldi bags made out of orange peel
etc.

As told to me by a BIP last night :-
 
"What's blue red and yellow and full of shit? An Aldi carrier bag."
 
Needless to say, I toasted the heretic. But seriously, Aldi carrier bags
do
have a vast array of possible uses.
 
1. To carry your shopping home from Aldi.
2. To carry other things in.
3. To use as wallpaper.
4. To use as carpet/tablecloth/any home decoration.
5. To suffocate people with.
6. To use as socks.
 
Need I carry on?
