&gt; Anyone bored enough to estimate how many years it would take to save up
&gt; enough piss to turn Niagra Falls yellow for a given amount of time?

Yes.

&lt;URL: http://content.health.msn.com/content/article/42/1685_50194? &gt;

Assume 1 litre of very yellow urine per person per day.

&lt;URL: http://www.niagarafallslive.com/Facts_about_Niagara_Falls.htm &gt;

750,000 US gallons a second is 2835000 litres a second.

If we assume that 1 litre of very yellow urine can colour 5 litres of
water (not unreasonable since we're talking about very large quantities
and it'll tend to enhance the colour effect), we need 567000 litres of
urine a second. Or about 1500 person-years of piss to provide one second
of coloured Niagara Falls.

A small town could do it easily in a year.

Hurrah!  I don't really understand something - if God made everything on Earth perfect, so that nothing ever went wrong, no-one got killed, there were no wars,famine or anything, and He influenced everyone's choices so they always made theright ones, surely you'd accuse God of being a dictator, depriving you of the right to free will?  Surely the fact that God gave us the choice to ignore Him completely or follow Him suggests He is a loving God!

Hey, having _one_ good page on a website is already doing better than
most. Admittedly it is an error page, but even so, it is several orders
magnitude better than most websites just because of that.

"Eastenders At Right Angles" is such a good idea!

All Sunday TV up to and including Eastenders Omnibus should be broadcast
sideways for the benefit of hangover ravaged party animals lying near
